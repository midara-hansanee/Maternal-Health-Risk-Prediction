# Maternal-Health-Risk-Prediction
The KNN algorithm's study of the UCI maternal health risk dataset

The analysis of the UCI Maternal Health Risk Dataset using the KNN algorithm using R highlights the potential of machine learning in identifying and understanding complex health patterns. By leveraging KNN’s ability to classify data based on proximity, we uncovered meaningful relationships between factors such as age, nutrition, socioeconomic status, and access to prenatal care, and their impact on maternal health.

 Looking ahead, integrating machine learning models like KNN into public health research can enable personalized treatments, more accurate risk assessments, and ultimately contribute to improved maternal outcomes worldwide.

This dataset was taken from
